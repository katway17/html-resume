<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>*Forgets everything about me*</p>

<p>My name is Kathleen and I am 29 years old. I currently live in southern Utah where the sand is red and the wind hurts your face. I've never met a cockroach before moving here, so that's fun. 
  I suppose first things first: I grew up in a large household. And by "large" I mean utterly massive. One dad, four moms, and forty-four siblings. Some might call that absolute nonsense, but we just called it life. Rest assured, I could tell you a story or fifty.

<p>Books are my thing. I am an avid reader to the bone. I try to read at least fifty books a year. My current record is one hundred, which I am proud of. I read anything and everything.
  From Austen's Pride and Prejudice to Booktok's filthiest garbage. There is no genre I don't read. 
  Another thing I love to do is write, which I suppose goes hand in hand with reading.

  I've always been computer savvy. I got into coding because I find it fascinating. Even as a kid, before I understood what coding was, my younger brother and I would try to get through the password one of our mom's put on our Window's computer because we weren't suppose to be on without permission. 
  We actually succeeded many times. All we wanted was to play our DOS games. (Best games ever.)  I constantly messed around with command prompt. I got into things I didn't understand. 
  Honestly, it was a way to pass the time, especially when the internet was blocked, or when it was hot af outside.
